# PORTFOLIO-PROJECTS

The Covid-19 pandemic has brought about numerous short-term and long-term consequences for human health, society, the economy, and the environment. The outbreak of this pandemic in 2019 has resulted in significant ripple effects on the daily lives of individuals and the global economy.

Currently, the impact of Covid-19 on everyday life is extensive and has profound implications.

For this project, I conducted an analysis and exploration of Covid-19 data using SQL through Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

The Covid-19 data used for this analysis was obtained from Our World in Data, covering the period from January 1, 2020, to July 12, 2023.
